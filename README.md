### Attention: you can locate the sample application in ./src/frontend/public/app

Few quick notes:

* we break down the code into modules to make them more manageable and easier to be migrated
* the application is organized using the structure mentioned in ServiceApp.Web document - _**however, we will use a more scalable structure for our application and please refer to "Stage 2: hybrid application running both AngularJs and Angular 2+" for more details**_
* we use webpack for bundling and karma to run our tests. _**for proper configurations of tools such as webpack and karma, please also refer to "Stage 2: hybrid application running both AngularJs and Angular 2+" for more details**_
