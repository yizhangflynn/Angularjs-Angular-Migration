### Attention: you can locate the sample application in ./src/frontend/app

Few quick notes:

* the application is structured similar to how we structure our application now
* definitions for modules, controllers and services are mixed with each other
* html and css code are mixed with each other in addition to a global css style sheet
* you will see other common issues pointed out in ServiceApp.Web document in sample application
